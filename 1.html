  <h2>About RISD</h2>
    (hello web. I'm <strong>creating a <u>web</u> page)</strong>.
    <p><a href=https://www.risd.edu/
      target=_blank title="about RISD">RISD</a>'s graduate program in Graphic Design prepares students for professional
      practice by emphasizing the roles of social context, media and aesthetics
      in the production of visible language systems.</p> <p style=margin-top:45px;>As a reflection of the discipline itself, the program encourages a nimble and intelligent response to constant change and burgeoning technology, while building a strong foundation of formal, aesthetic and analytical knowledge. MFA candidates choose between two program tracks: a two-year option for students entering with undergraduate degrees in graphic design or other visual communication, and a three-year option for those with degrees in liberal arts, the sciences or fine arts. Built on a sequence of required courses, the curricula for both allow candidates to tailor individual courses of study through cross-disciplinary electives.</p> <img src=coding.jpg width=100%><img src=coding2.jpg width=100%>
